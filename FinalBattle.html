                    <p>You follow the hidden tunnel into a large, cool cavern. A natural pillar of rock supports the ceiling, and three large stalagmites rise from the stone floor. To the west, you see three bedrolls and a messy heap of mining supplies—sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, and shovels. Amid the supplies, a humanoid form lies still. The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a dark pit approximately ten feet wide; a sturdy hemp rope is tied around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down into the chasm.</p>

                            <p><strong>Life Drain:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (4d8+3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
                            <p><strong>Create Specter:</strong> The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a specter in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The specter is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.</p>

My treasures are mine alone, not yours to plunder!" If the characters make no attempt to reason with him, he attacks. If they try to reason (provided they haven't harmed him or seized property), he listens. He is irrevocably evil, but values magic items (especially scrolls), spellbooks, and arcane knowledge. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince him of an offering's value. He won't relinquish the wooden pipe in the chest but might part with coins/gems if the PCs agree to kill the Spectator in Area 15. If satisfied, he allows them to peruse his books and find the map.</p>

The floor is smooth, natural stone, slick with moisture in places. The centerpiece of the cavern is a wide stone brazier filled with roiling, pulsating magical green flames—the Forge of Spells. This eerie light casts dancing green shadows across the chamber. Numerous large stalagmites offer substantial cover. Parts of the cavern are festooned with thick, sticky webs, obscuring vision and making movement difficult. Four ominous, dark obsidian crystals, veined with sickly green light, are placed strategically around the Forge brazier, roughly 15-20 feet from it; two of them are already glowing brightly with an unnatural luminescence.</p>
